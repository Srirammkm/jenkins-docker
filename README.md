# jenkins-docker
This contains the Dockerfile which is required to install docker and docker-compose inside the jenkins container.
Since I uploaded the image version of the file in dockerhub. you can directly download the docker installed jenkins image from https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/srirammk18/jenkins-docker
